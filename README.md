# Face Detection Using YOLO

This repository contains a YOLO-based face detection model trained on a custom dataset. The model can detect faces in images or video streams with high accuracy.

You can see the live demo of the model [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/shahanmalik/face-detection).

---

## Dataset

The model was fine-tuned using the [Face Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fareselmenshawii/face-detection-dataset) from Kaggle. The dataset includes diverse images for robust face detection.

---

## Model Architecture

The model uses the **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** framework, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm known for its speed and accuracy.

---

## Features

- Detects faces in real-time.
- High accuracy and performance.
- Easily customizable for other object detection tasks.
